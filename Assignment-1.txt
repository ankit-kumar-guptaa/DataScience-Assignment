Q-1Create one variable containing following type of data:
(i) string
(ii) list
(iii) float
(iv) tuple
Answer:-
# (i) String
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# (ii) List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# (iii) Float
my_float = 3.14

# (iv) Tuple
my_tuple = (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

Q2. Given are some following variables containing data:
(i) var1 = ‘ ‘
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ]
(iv) var4 = 1.
Answer:-
(i) var1 is a string variable that contains an empty string. It doesn't have any characters within the quotation marks.

(ii) var2 is also a string variable that contains a string representation of a list. The list elements are 'DS', 'ML', and 'Python'. Note that the elements are enclosed in single quotes within the square brackets.

(iii) var3 is a list variable that directly contains three string elements: 'DS', 'ML', and 'Python'. The elements are enclosed in single quotes and separated by commas.

(iv) var4 is an integer variable that stores the value 1. It is not enclosed in quotation marks since it represents a numerical value, not a string.

the data type of the above given variable is List.

Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) /
(ii) %
(iii) //
(iv) **
Answer:-
i) / (Division Operator): The division operator is used to perform division between two numbers and returns the quotient as a floating-point number.
Example:
a = 10
b = 3
result = a / b
print(result)

(ii) % (Modulo Operator): The modulo operator is used to calculate the remainder of the division between two numbers.
Example:
a = 10
b = 3
result = a % b
print(result)

(iii) // (Floor Division Operator): The floor division operator is used to perform division between two numbers and returns the quotient as an integer, rounding down to the nearest whole number.
Example:
a = 10
b = 3
result = a // b
print(result)

(iv) ** (Exponentiation Operator): The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power.
Example:
a = 2
b = 3
result = a ** b
print(result)

Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the element and its data type.
Answer:-
my_list = [1, 2.5, 'Hello', True, [1, 2, 3], {'name': 'Ankit', 'age': 26}, None, (4, 5), 6 + 2j, False]

for element in my_list:
    print(f"Element: {element}, Data Type: {type(element)}")
